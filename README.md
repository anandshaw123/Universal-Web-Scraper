# Universal-Web-Scraper
⚒️Working Progress..


# ***`Small Overview:`***

- I am building a **Universal Web Scraper** where you will first need to choose an `API` key. Then, you have to enter the website link, and after that, specify the names or titles of the elements you want to scrape, such as customer_id, name, department, etc. Once the scraping is done, you can download the data in `CSV`, `JSON`, or `HTML` file formats. You can also scrape data from multiple pages at once, or limit it to just 3 pages if you prefer.
